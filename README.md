# K A R K I N O S

**KARKINOS** is a database of people interested in the [Rust programming language][Rust]. It uses the same data as [rustaceans.org], but presents it through a different interface.

I created Karkinos for these reasons:

- To provide access for users who browse with JavaScript disabled;

- To rewrite the backend in Rust (instead of Node.js);

- As a proving ground for my template engine, [Maud];

- To screw around with CSS (this is the most important reason).

Karkinos is named after a very special [giant crab].

## Setting up

Karkinos requires a nightly version of the Rust compiler. The easiest way to install this is through [rustup]:

    rustup override set nightly

[rustup]: https://rustup.rs/

Once you've got the compiler working, compile and run the server:

    RUST_LOG=logger,karkinos,error cargo run

You can then view the site at <http://localhost:8344>.
